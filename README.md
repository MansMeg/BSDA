# Bayesian Statistics and Data Analysis (BSDA) course (2ST128) at Uppsala University

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the Bayesian Statistics and Data Analysis at Uppsala University. This repo contains all necessary material and information for the course. 

The course is build upon a similar course given at Aalto University. This course can be found [here](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/index.html).


## Course Target Audience 
The course is given to second-year master students in the Statistics masters program and interested PhD students.

This course has a strong emphasis in computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest computational tools.


## Prerequisites and Course Goals
See course syllabus with course goals [here](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=47023&type=1).

The basic prerequisites can be summarized in:
- Basic probability theory:
  - probability, probability density function (pdf), distribution, 
  - sum, product rule, and Bayes’ rule
  - expectation, mean, variance, median
- Some linear algebra and calculus
- Basic programming in R (main language) or Python


## (Rough) Course Plan and Reading Instructions
You can find a rough course plan with reading instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMN6pWULQIs_klRyunyS3OiQZ5ty67Smljo6gcxc1dQ68c4dDoZlSJTmDowYixvPZpANqDhSIA40Cs/pubhtml). More detailed reading instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/main/reading_instructions/reading_instructions.pdf).


## Schedule
You can find the course schedule on TimeEdit [here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/uu/web/schema/) (search for course code 2ST128).


## Grading
The course is graded with U (Underkänd/Fail), G (Godkänd/Pass), VG (väl godkänd/Pass with distinction).

To pass, you should pass all assignments and the mini-project *at the set deadline*. 

On each assignment, if everything is correct (>90% of points), a VG point will be awarded. Similarly on the mini-project, if it is considered to be very good, 2 VG points can be awarded. A total of 7 or more VG points is needed to get VG on the course. 

## Follow up and late submissions
There are two follow up deadlines (or follow-up corrections) during the course. First, the assignments can be submitted again at the deadline of the project work. Then additional submissions of assignments will be corrected. Also, roughly one month after the end of the course, assignments can be turned in again. *Assignments submitted in after the first deadline cannot get VG*.

The project can also be turned in a second time a month after the end of the course. Then the student(s) need to submit both a project report, a PDF with presentation slides and a link to a video presentation of the mini-project.
*Projects submitted in after the first deadline cannot get VG*.

### Complementary Reading

Below are some suggested complementary reading for the interested student.

- For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, “Regression and Other Stories”.
- Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn’t go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard’s lecture videos of Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
- For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in Kruschke, “Doing Bayesian Data Analysis” useful.

## Course practicalities

Online course discussions will be held at Studium.


### Location

Most lectures will be held on campus. There might be a guest lecture that will be held over Zoom. The computer lab will be held through zoom to facilitate many sessions.

You can find information and support for students on Zoom [here](https://mp.uu.se/c/perm/link?p=267521030).

## Course structure

### Main part
The course consists of rougly 8 blocks (weeks) of material. Each week consists of the following (expected workload in parenthesis):
- One to two lecture(s) and computer labs (approx. 2-4h per week)
- Online video material and reading assignments (approx. 2-6 h per week)
- An individual computer assignment (approx. 10-12 h per week)

### Computer assignments
Each week an individual computer assignment is done with a focus on computational aspects of Bayesian Statistics. Each assignment is completed individually and should follow the computer [assignment_template](https://github.com/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/master/templates/). There is also a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/main/templates/assignment_template.Rtex) that can be used on Overleaf.

We also supply a Google Colab assignment template with all R packages installed (or rather code to install them). This is an alternative if there are problems with getting the code to run locally. The template can be found [here](https://github.com/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/main/templates/bsda_colab_template.ipynb) or can be open directly in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/main/templates/bsda_colab_template.ipynb).

Students should return the computer assignments no later than **Sunday 23.59 each week**. A second possibility to turn in assignments is possible after the end of the course. For a detailed list of deadlines, see the [course plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMN6pWULQIs_klRyunyS3OiQZ5ty67Smljo6gcxc1dQ68c4dDoZlSJTmDowYixvPZpANqDhSIA40Cs/pubhtml).

There are two complementary turn-ins of assignments, the last day of the course and roughly 2-4 weeks after the course ends. After the last possible time to turn in the assignment no more chances will be given. In this case, you will be failed on the course and you will need to retake the course next year.



Each assignment will be graded and evaluated within 10 working days.

Students are not allowed to show your assignments (text or code) to anyone. Only discuss the assignments with other students. The student that show their assignment to anyone else could also be considered to cheat. Similarly, on zoom labs, only screen share when you are in a separate zoom room with teaching assistants.

### Bayesian Model Averaging
A guest lecture will be given on by Ph.D. student [Valentin Zulj](https://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N19-813).

## Course Mini-Project
The last two weeks will focus on a course project where 2-3 students choose their data and will conduct a Bayesian data analysis of the given data. 

You can find details and instructions on the project work [here](https://github.com/MansMeg/BSDA/blob/master/project/).
