\textbf{Reporting accuracy:} For posterior statistics of interest, only report digits for which the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) is zero. \emph{Example:} If you estimate $E(\mu)=1.234$ with MCSE($E(\mu)$) = 0.01, you should report $E(\mu)=1.2$.

When computing the $\hat{R}$ diagnostics, you only need to include two decimals.
