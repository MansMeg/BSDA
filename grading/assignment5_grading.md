### Q9 - 1 point

2 e) Is the warm-up length reported?

- No
- Yes

### Q10 - 1 point

2 f) Is the number of chains reported?

- No
- Yes

### Q11 - 1 point

2 g) and 2 h) Are line plots of the chains included? (Separate plots for alpha and beta)

- No plots are included
- Yes, but both plots are in a single figure, or the plots are scatter plots (scatter plots aren't useful for visual convergence evaluation). (0.5p)
- Yes, but only a plot for alpha or beta is included. (0.5p)
- Yes, separate line plots for both alpha and beta are included.

### Q12 - 1 point

Is there a discussion on the convergence of the chains? 

- No discussion on convergence.
- Yes, but the discussion is not convincing. (0.5p)
- Yes, discussed in the report.

### Q13 - 1 point

Is it mentioned which implementation of Rhat is used ?

- No
- Yes


### Q14 - 1 point

Is the brief correct description of Rhat included? 

### Q15 - 1 point

Are the Rhat-values for alpha and beta reported?

- No
- Yes, but incorrectly computed. (0.5p)
- Yes, but computed separately for each chain (0.5p)
- Yes, but only for alpha or beta (0.5p)
- Yes, single values both for alpha and beta

### Q16 - 1 point

Is the interpretation of Rhat values correct?

- No interpretation or discussion about the Rhat-values, or conclusions clearly wrong
- Somewhat correct (0.5p)
- Interpretation correct

### Q17 - 1 point

Does the report contain a scatter plot of the draws of alpha and beta? Do the results look reasonable?

- No plot included
- Plot included, but the results do not look correct (0.5p)
- Plot included, and the results look roughly correct
