## Exercise 1

### Q3 - 1p

Is the Stan model code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q4 - 3p

1. Does the implemented Stan-model seem to be working?

- No implementation
- Model implemented but results not visualized/reported (1p)
- Model implemented, but the results seem weird (1p)
- Model seems to work correctly

### Q5 - 1p

2. Are the R_hat values reported (potential scale reduction factor, Eq. (11.4) in the BDA3)?

- No
- Yes, but only for alpha or beta (0.5p)
- Yes, one value for alpha and one for beta

### Q6 - 1p

2. Is the interpretation of Rhat values correct?

- No interpretation or discussion about the R_hat-values, or conclusions clearly wrong
- Somewhat correct (0.5p)
- Interpretation correct

### Q7 - 1p

3. Does the report contain a scatter plot of the draws? Do the results look reasonable, that is, roughly like in the Figure below (figure attached in peergrade)?

- No plot included or clearly incorrect plot
- Plot included, but the results do not look correct (0.5p)
- Plot included, and the results look roughly correct
